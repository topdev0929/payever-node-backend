    'Description': 'For tubing and piping applications, stainless steel is a common selection because it is highly chemical- and corrosion-resistant. However, type 304 stainless steel is not compatible with applications where temperatures fall between 800 and 1640 degrees Fahrenheit (F) because it is prone to carbide precipitation, a result of the material’s .08 percent carbon content limit. Stainless steel type 304L circumvents this problem because it has a lower carbon content limit, and therefore can be subjected to welding and higher temperature applications.',

    'Description': 'Aluminium pipes are commonly used in industrial, automotive, marine and aerospace industry; Great for custom fabrication project such as DIY air intake, cooling systems, turbo intercooler piping setup because 6061 aluminum is the most popular and versatile alloy, and is the least expensive of the heat treatable aluminum alloys. HPS aluminum round tubing is sold in the T6 condition, ideal for sawing, machining, sanding, and polishing. The aluminum pipe can be polished, but due to the softness of the aluminum, care must be taken not to remove too much material, especially in the area near any welds. ',
