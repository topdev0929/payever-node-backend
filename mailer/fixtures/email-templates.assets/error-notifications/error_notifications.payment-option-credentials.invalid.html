<p>Dear Merchant,<p>
<p>we need your help to resolving an issue with your payever account. The payment credentials used for payment <b>{{integration | payment_option}}</b> are invalid or have expired. Please make sure you are using your credentials correctly.<p>
<p>{{credentials}}<p>
<p>
  {% if business.name is defined %}Business: {{business.name}}<br>{% endif %}
  {% if errorDateFormatted is defined %}Time: {{errorDateFormatted}}{% endif %}
</p>
<p>Since future payments are likely to fail as well, we wonâ€™t be able to process any further payments for payment <b>{{integration | payment_option}}</b> unless the problem will be resolved.<p>
<p>You can retry the payment option by updating the credentials inside payever Connect in your account.<p>
<p>You can find answers to the most frequent questions in our documentation. You have further questions? Please contact our customer support.
